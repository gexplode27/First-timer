## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Carbon Dioxide Emission from 1995-2018 Analysis
**Code:** [`CO2 EMISSION.ipynb`](https://github.com/gexplode27/First-timer/blob/main/Emission/CO2%20EMISSION.ipynb)    
**Description:** The dataset contains 8910 records from 1995-2018. There is a list of emission with Country, Year,Industry and Indicator. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based on country, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Review of the global emission.  

### Airbnb Listings Analytics 
**Tableau Public:** [`dashboard`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lahm8055/viz/USAGDP2001-2018/Dashboard1)    

**Description:** Tableau Public dashboard consisted of: calculated GDP of USA from 2001-2018; analytical chart to determine which state,region and sub-region have highest GDP, calculating average GDP per sub-region and forecasting of GDP for the next two years.    
**Technology:** Tableau.    
**Results:** created an analytical dashboard to showcase GDP for each County in USA.

### Tableau Vizzes
**Description:** My Tableau Public account ---> [go to Tableau..](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lahm8055/) 
**Status:** âˆž 

## Certificates
I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result:) So here is a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):
